  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <hr />
  <p>I am currently an aspiring web developer increasing my skills everyday. I plan to move into this industry and truly enjoy it. My body has been beat and battered doing labourous jobs, and having expertise in customer service and being technically sound, I truly believe this is where I can thrive. I believe my reason why is strong enough to push me through the gritty days, and I do truly enjoy learning to how code and learning about this field of choice.</p>

  <h2>Hobbies & What You Can Catch Me Doing Outside of Work</h2>
  <hr />
  <ul>
    <li><h3>Surfing</h3>
      <ul>
        <br />
        <li>I'm from Vancouver so you might catch me in Tofino, or most likely on social media posting surfing photos and liking tons of surfing content. Apolagize in Advance if we follow each other.</li>

    <br />
  <ul>
      <li><h3>Travelling & Backpacking</h3>
        <ul>
          <br />
          <li>Another thing you might see me posting and liking alot of is backpacking & travelling content. Posting videos and photos of new experiences with new faces and trying local foods in South East Asia or Central America. I've got bitten by the travel bug ever since my first backpacking trip to Asia and that's all I seem to ponder about on my free time; is the taste of more adventure. Another reason why I like the idea of being a web developer; is, I can bring the work anywhere in the world!</li>

    <li><h3>Bars with Good Live Music</h3>
      <ul>
        <br />
        <li>The Philippines as you may know has amazing performing artists. That's where my world of 'going out into town' opened up, from dark nightclubs to well lit bars with local artists playing covers to more slower, feelier songs, that just seem to get the vibe right. One of the best nights out I've ever had, was at a bar in the Philippines that had super talented live performers. The atmosphere was so warm and welcoming, like I was at my nanas house. The conversations with fellow strangers felt natural and the ambience was just set to perfect. A night I can still reminisce on. If you know of any, please point me in the direction of a bar with a great vibe and talented performers.</li>
