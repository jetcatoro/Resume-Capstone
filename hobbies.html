  <hr />
  <h2>Surfing</h2>
    <p>I'm from Vancouver so you might catch me in Tofino, or most likely on social media posting surfing photos and liking tons of surfing content. Apolagize in advance if we follow each other.</p>
    <br />
  <h2>Travelling & Backpacking</h2>
    <p>Another thing you might see me posting and liking alot of is backpacking & travel content. Posting videos and photos of new experiences with new faces and trying local foods in places like South East Asia or Central America. I've got bitten by the travel bug ever since my first backpacking trip to Asia and that's all I seem to ponder on in my free time. Another reason why I like the idea of being a web developer also, is that, I can bring the work with me anywhere in the world!</p>

  <h2>Bars with Good Live Music</h2>
    <p>The Philippines as you may know has some amazing performing artists. That's where my world of 'going out into town' really started to open up. Going from dark nightclubs to well lit bars with local artists playing covers to more slower, feelier songs, that just seem to get the vibe right. One of the best nights out I've ever had, was at a bar in the Philippines that had super talented live performers. The atmosphere just felt so warm and welcoming, like I was at my nanas house. The conversations with fellow strangers felt natural and the ambience was just set to perfect. A night I can still reminisce on. If you know of any, please point me in the direction of a bar with a great vibe and talented performers. </p>
