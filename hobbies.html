<body>
  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <br />
  <p>I am currently an aspiring web developer increasing my skills everyday. I plan to move into this industry and truly enjoy it. My body has been beat and battered doing labourous jobs, and being very customer service focused and technically sound, I truly believe this is where I belong. I believe my reason why is strong enough to push me through the difficult days, and I do truly enjoy learning to how code and learning about the industry.</p>
  <br />
  <h2>Hobbies & What you can Catch me Doing Outside of Work</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Surfing
      <ul>
        <br />
        <li>I'm from Vancouver so you might catch me in Tofino, or most likely on social media posting surfing photos of myself and liking tons of surfing content. Apolagize in Advance if we follow each other.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
    <br />
  <ul>
      <li>Travelling & Backpacking
        <ul>
          <br />
          <li>Another thing you might see me posting and liking alot of is wandering and exploring our world. I've got bitten by the travel bug ever since my first backpacking trip to Asia and that's all I seem to want at this point in life; is the taste of more life long friendships &
           adventure. Another reason why I like the idea of being a web developer; is, I can bring the work with me remotely and work anywhere in the world!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <ul>
    <li>Bars with Good Live Music
      <ul>
        <br />
        <li>The Philippines as you may know has amazing performing artists. That's when I fell in love with bars attuned to fit live music with their vibe. One of the best days I have ever had, was a night out with friends at a bar in the Philippines that had amazing live music. The vibe felt so warm and welcoming, like all was okay in this world. The conversations with fellow strangers felt so natural and the vibe was just perfect. Please point me in the direction of a bar with a great vibe and great msuic. </li>
