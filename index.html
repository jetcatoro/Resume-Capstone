  <h1>Eubert Ayangwa</h1>
    <p>Friendly Individual who loves to bring a smile to everyone's day along with quality customer service & technical expertise.</p>
    <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
    <p class="intro">I am currently an aspiring web developer increasing my skills on a daily basis. I'm a  person that likes to keep my brain sharp and learn something new everyday. I enjoy learning how to code as this industry seems to have something new popping out the woodward on a regular basis. Forcing to keep my brain sharp, but also requiring very little physical demand. I've beaten the crap out of my body doing numerous labour jobs and it's finally time to start working smarter not harder. I have nothing but respect for people who do phyiscal labour because they either enjoy it or need to do it to make ends meet. Although, I know I'm fortunate enough to have enough time and still no responsibilites to be able to make a career switch. For that I'm forever grateful for and don't take for granted. I strongly believe I've put myself through hell and back with some jobs I've put myself through. Not saying coding is easy, as I know this industry can have frustrating moments like any other. Although, I believe my reason why is strong enough to push past those gritty day. I mean this with all due respect, but I never want to abuse my body ever again just to make a living. I've found out my strengths are cerebral and the physical can stay put for activities outside of work, which my body thanks me for.</p>
    <p class="intro"><b>Below is my work experience and the rest of my resume. It will show you all the jobs I have put myself through, even the ones where I had short stints. I want to show you what I have gone through and learned until now to give you a good picture as to why I desire to move into this field. Thank you for your time.</b></p>
